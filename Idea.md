# 🛒 Project Idea – ShopSmart (E-Commerce Website)

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Many small businesses and local sellers want to sell their products online but face difficulties using large and complex e-commerce platforms. These platforms often require high costs, advanced technical knowledge, and complicated setups, which makes them unsuitable for small-scale sellers.

There is a need for a simple, lightweight e-commerce website that allows sellers to showcase and manage their products online while providing customers with an easy way to browse products.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
ShopSmart is a lightweight e-commerce web application designed for small sellers. It provides a simple interface for customers to browse products and an admin side where sellers can manage product listings.

The application focuses on core e-commerce functionality such as product listing, viewing product details, and managing product information using a RESTful backend API.
